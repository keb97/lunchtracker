== Hello and Welcome to Lunchtracker ==

This app records what day you ate a lunch ("day"), what fruit you ate ("fruit), and how many total items you ate ("items").
The inputs for day and fruit should both be strings and the input for items should be a float. 
Each entry will be displayed in the app, and will also remain available for editing and deleting according to your preference.
